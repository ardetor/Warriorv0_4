# ON HIATUS AS OF 06 JAN 2017
Many aspects of this game are non-traditional, requiring different handling than normal games. Parts of it have been tricky to figure out, and as a result design and implementation has been slow and error-prone. Due to this, this project will be on hiatus until the developer gets a better handle on things, presently expected to be indefinite. A new version may be released instead of updating this one.


# Warrior
An RPG for Android. 

Currently implemented: 
 - Title Screen
 - Journal
 - Body mechanics

Work in progress:
 - Combat mechanics: Unlike normal games, this RPG eschews abstract health bars in favour of tracking detailed statistics about individual body parts, making combat much more strategic and realistic.
 - Novel magic system: Once again, this game plans to depart from textbook skill trees. Instead of players being informed that they have "learned" a spell, players now have to learn spells in truth by discovering what combination of magical energy is required, whether through in-game books or by simple trial and error.
 - Storyline: This game aims to break standard storytelling tropes. There may be a pattern here.
