# Warriorv0_4
An RPG for Android. 

Current features: 
 - Title Screen. I have to start somewhere, don't I?

Planned features:
 - Very deep combat mechanics: say goodbye to abstract HP bars and arbitrary skill trees.
 - Free storyline. All decisions are yours to make. The consequences, however, will also be yours to bear.
