# Warrior
An RPG for Android. 

Currently implemented: 
 - Title Screen
 - Journal
 - Body mechanics

Work in progress:
 - Combat mechanics: Unlike normal games, this RPG eschews abstract health bars in favour of tracking detailed statistics about individual body parts, making combat much more strategic and realistic.
 - Novel magic system: Once again, this game plans to depart from textbook skill trees. Instead of players being informed that they have "learned" a spell, players now have to learn spells in truth by discovering what combination of magical energy is required, whether through in-game books or by simple trial and error.
 - Storyline - work in progress. However, this game aims to break standard storytelling tropes. There may be a pattern here.
